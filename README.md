# Rotational Shaft Dynamics Simulator

This project investigates the nonlinear dynamics of a rotational steel shaft under motor-applied torque. It compares MATLAB (with friction) and Simulink simulations (without friction). A custom GUI synchronizes MATLAB and Simulink results in a linked animation for direct visual comparison over time. Validation is achieved by examining peak responses in graphs and through numerical comparison. The study demonstrates how friction influences shaft behavior, providing insight for the design and control of rotational systems.
