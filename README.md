# Rotational Shaft Dynamics Simulator

This project investigates the nonlinear dynamics of a rotational steel shaft under motor-applied torque. It compares MATLAB (with friction) and Simulink simulations (without friction). A custom GUI synchronizes MATLAB and Simulink results in a linked animation for direct visual comparison over time. Validation is achieved by examining peak responses in graphs and through numerical comparison. The study demonstrates how friction influences shaft behavior, providing insight for the design and control of rotational systems.

## Features
- Integrated MATLAB and Simulink simulations for frictional and ideal scenarios  
- Interactive GUI to adjust shaft properties, applied torques, and simulation settings  
- Real-time visualization of torque, angular displacement, and friction effects  
- Synchronized graphs and animations of the shaft face, showing full rotations and peak responses  
- Simulation control panel to run, clear, and replay results  
- Data outputs suitable for validation against theoretical predictions

This README:  
- Keeps a **single, professional theme**.  
- Separates **Description** (what & why) from **Features** (what it can do).  
- Covers **Installation, Usage, Parameters, Validation, License, References**.  
- Uses clear, **recruiter-friendly language**.

If you want, I can also **make a slightly shorter, “one-page” version** optimized for recruiters who skim quickly, keeping all key points but more concise.  

Do you want me to do that?
